OpenSense 6 API: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2224682

Using an AOSP rom as a base, Inject the HTC Sense 6 Blinkfeed 2.0 propriety files into the system/. By doing this, you grant users a Sense 6 experience on their device. Using this as a base, developers can go forward with this and continue porting the rest of the M8's apps and framework to the desired device. 

Using the OpenSense 6 API allows developers to create their own HTC apps for their HTC custom firmware! We could also use the libs and inject them into the source of an AOSP rom and possibly compile a home brew HTC rom but the developer responsible for the compile must rewrite the source of each package that to be desired to have an HTC UI injected to it. This would be used in a case that an app could not be ported from the original M8 firmware. Example: If a dev couldnt port the HTC Settings, they would take the original android settings and inject HTC Actionbar as well as HTC Preferences and theme layouts to the Android Source and rebuild it. Ofcourse this method isnt garunteed untill the developer has successfully ported the HTC framework to which HTC apps can be run in the OpenSense rom "Which shouldnt be to difficult? we only hope..."

Google play and Google services are required in the rom as thats how HTC now updates their Sense 6 devices. Blinkfeed and HTC services are now updated via Google Play and as far as were aware, it wont affect the port on your device however we dont recomend doing any rating on the playstore with your port as the device model will show and HTC might change things on us and ruin this...

More info as it becomes avaialable.
